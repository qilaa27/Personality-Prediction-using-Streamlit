# Extrovertâ€“Introvert Personality Classifier

This group project builds and deploys a **machine learning model** to classify individuals as **Extrovert or Introvert** based on social-behavior data (2,900 records, 8 features).

Link for the explanation (in bahasa): https://bit.ly/PresentationPersonality 
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create an end-to-end ML pipelineâ€”data preprocessing, model training, and deploymentâ€”that predicts personality type from behavioral inputs such as:
- Time spent alone
- Stage fear
- Social event attendance
- Friends-circle size
- Social media post frequency
and other related lifestyle features.

## ðŸ›  Implementation
- **Modeling:** Compared and tuned **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**; best accuracy reached **93%**.
- **Backend:** **FastAPI** for serving predictions.
- **Frontend:** **Streamlit** interactive web app for user input and real-time results.
- **Artifacts Delivered:** 
  - Dataset  
  - Jupyter notebook pipeline (`.ipynb`)  
  - Trained model (`.pkl`)  
  - FastAPI backend (`.py`)  
  - Streamlit frontend (`.py`)

## ðŸš€ Usage & Output
Users input test data from a CSV file into the Streamlit form.  

This project demonstrates a complete ML deployment workflow, enabling accurate personality classification through a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit web interface.
